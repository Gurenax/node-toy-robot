# Toy Robot Simulator

I created this project as an exercise to this very popular coding test problem. The solution that you will see here is purely my style of solving the problem and it is not by any means the only solution to the exercise.


## Here are the links to the Problem and Solution

* [SOLUTION](/docs/SOLUTION.md) (_Warning: Do not read the Solution if you haven't tried to solve this yourself_)


## Confessions. I have done this coding test before and failed horribly

### It is supposedly an `easy` problem.

* But sometimes what is easy comes with a catch.

### What went wrong? How does someone with my years of experience fail to such a problem?

* I was comfortable and I did not bother to master more languages.

  * I only knew `Java` and `PHP/VB.NET/ABAP`, but I did it in Java because I knew Java and I was loyal to Java. Don't get me wrong. Java is not all that bad, but trying to learn more languages will improve your overall perspective of programming. It will improve your coding style and maturity to what the employer expects of you.

  * Culture got in the way. The company I worked for previously for several years did not promote a culture of continuous learning. The world simply was not the same when I got in the company and when I got out.

  * Team Leading got in the way. Getting more senior responsibilities sometimes put you out of practice. You get home, and you feel very tired and unmotivated to code, and you could not practice.

* I wrote tests because I read about `Test Driven Development` but I was not doing it properly.

  * My tests were convoluted.
  * I did not practice writing tests.
  * I only knew `JUnit`.

* My code did not look clean.
  * Anything more than 10-15 lines is a `code smell`.

* I did not follow instructions.

  * I did not push to Github because I did not know how to use Git/Github properly.
  * I created a UI (Java Swing) to impress the employer. It did not impress the employer because `It is not required to provide any graphical output`.

* I did not get rid of unwanted files

  * MacOS usually produces unwanted dot files (e.g. .DS_Store). This annoys employers.
  * I did not use `gitignore`

* I wrote a word document instead of a Markdown

## What could I have done differently?

* If possible, go back in time and learn `Ruby`. Ruby teaches you to write clean and readable code.

* And when I learn Ruby, I need to understand that I don't have to do it in Ruby. I can do it in any language (e.g. JavaScript) but with the cleanliness and discipline of Ruby code in mind.

* Learn Git, GitHub, Git workflows, anything Git, use gitignore

* Write better tests. Tests should tell you a story. They should be as functional as the functions/methods you write. They should be able to stand on their own and should not be linked to other tests.

* Read the instructions and follow it carefully. Sometimes the stress makes you see things you are not supposed to.

* Write a better Solution README using Markdown.


## What am I going to do differently this time?

* I will not do this during the test period. I will do it ahead of any job application.
* I know Ruby now, but I will do it in `JavaScript` as it helps me think in a more functional way.
* I will make it as functional as possible as it is easier to think in smaller parts.
* I will structure my data better.

* I will write better, cleaner and more functional tests with properly mocked data.
* I will read the instructions carefully. Every character and every word of that `PROBLEM.md`.
* I will write a better Solution README (`SOLUTION.md`) using Markdown. 

## Why am I writing these?

* Because it helps me realise my failures.
* Because it could help someone else.
* Because there is power in writing information. It is what drives the internet, to begin with.
